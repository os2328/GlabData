# GlabData
Datasets catalog for Glab


- Please, add datasets that you work with or know of.
- It's created by everyone and for everyone!
- Put an emphasis on **your** expertise - what is unique about this dataset? what is it good for? what are the words of caution when using it? 
- Add relevant scripts and/or links to downloaded/preprocessed dataset if you have it available on Ginsburg or elsewhere. 


Whenever you have some "free" time and you feel like doing something productive but don't feel like doing what you usually do - remember this side project.

Let's make it useful together :) 

Some technical moments:

- create a "Data Card" for your dataset and add to data_cards/ directory. Use [Template](Template.md) as a guide. 
- add a link you the card in the [Catalog](_Catalog.md)
- and [Variable index](_Variable_index.md)
