# CLASS4GL

**Short description**

The framework CLASS4GL is designed to facilitate the investigation of the atmospheric boundary layer evolution in response to different land and atmospheric conditions observed around the world. The core of the platform is the model CLASS that is used to simulate the evolution of the atmospheric boundary layer. Instruction video about the boundary layer processes and how they are considered in the CLASS model can be found as on the CLASS model website. Observational data from balloons, satellites and reanalysis, are used to constrain and initialize the model. CLASS4GL uses 2 million global balloon soundings from the integrated global radio sounding archive and satellite data from the last 40 years.
